"1Partials  are counted  if there are two or more overlaping genes. However, the partial matches tab contains all operons that overlap by even one gene.",,,
"Note: many of the predicted operons have large distances between genes. Therefore, the upstream gene may be correct in the prediction, or there may be a un-annotated gene closer to the downstream gene.",,,
